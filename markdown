# Coding Rules

## 1. Indentation and Formatting:

- Use consistent indentation (tabs or spaces).
- Follow a consistent code formatting style for readability.

## 2. Naming Conventions:

- Use descriptive and meaningful variable, function, and file names.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (camelCase, snake_case).

## 3. Class Naming Conventions:

- Use a descriptive and concise name for classes.
- Follow a consistent class naming convention (e.g., `.submit__btn`).

## 4. Comments:

- Add comments to explain complex code, especially where the logic might not be immediately apparent.
- Keep comments concise, avoiding unnecessary information.

## 5. Modularity and Separation of Concerns:

- Organize code into modular components for better maintainability.
- Follow the separation of concerns principle to keep different aspects of the application distinct (e.g., separate views, models, and controllers).

## 6. Error Handling:

- Implement proper error handling for critical sections of code.
- Provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.

## 7. Code Duplication:

- Avoid redundant code by identifying and refactoring duplicated logic.
- Reuse code through functions or modules when appropriate.

## 8. Consistent Code Reviews:

- Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality.
- Follow a checklist for code reviews, covering aspects such as performance, security, and adherence to coding standards.

## 9. Version Control:

- Use version control (e.g., Git) effectively.
- Commit small, focused changes with descriptive commit messages.

## 10. Documentation:

    - Document important functions, classes, and modules.
    - Update the README file with clear installation, configuration, and usage instructions.

## 11. Testing:

    - Write unit tests for critical functionality.
    - Ensure new features and bug fixes are covered by tests.

## 12. Security:

    - Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## 13. Performance:

    - Optimize critical sections of code for better performance.
    - Regularly review and optimize database queries.

## 14. Consistent Styling:

    - Follow a consistent styling guide for both frontend and backend code.
    - Use linting tools to enforce coding standards.
    - Follow a consistent class naming convention (e.g., `.submit__btn`).

## 15. Environment Configuration:

    - Use environment variables for configuration settings.
    - Do not hardcode sensitive information like API keys.

## 16. Collaboration:

    - Foster a collaborative environment where team members can openly discuss and suggest improvements.
    - Be open to feedback and continuously strive for improvement.
